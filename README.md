# Hedge-fund

## Introduction

Welcome to Hedge Fund, the application that easily allows anyone to create a bid for any work they need done on their property and have contractors bid on the work!

## Login & Signup:

Logins and signups are run through passport and bcrypt for security purposes. When signing up, you can either specify if you are a client looking for work to be done, or a contractor looking for jobs and winning work.

## Clients:

Clients can create a new account and specify their name and location. Clients are allowed to create new jobs, as well as view previous jobs that they have created. When creating a job, you can enter in a description of what you need done and upload photos of the area in question. Once submitted, you can go back and edit your created jobs in case you need to modify your scope of work.

## Contractors:

Contractors can create a new account where they can specify the name of their company and their location. Contractors have the ability to define a search radius to make sure that they can view all relevant jobs in the area. They can then click on any specified job to place a bid, review the photos, etc.
